# Local Cloud

Local Cloud is a lightweight, locally hosted cloud application that enables you to set up a private file server on your computer. The application allows you to access, browse, and download files from your computer through a web interface, accessible from any device within your local network.

Built with React and TypeScript, Local Cloud provides an efficient and user-friendly way to manage your files in a local environment, making it ideal for private networks or small teams who need quick access to files without relying on third-party cloud services.
